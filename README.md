##### In-house job execution framework
Coauthor of a distributed system designed as a solution to cron limitations. The system is multi-master, multi-satellite, with each satellite managing its own cluster of workers (job runners).

Written in Node.js, it uses MongoDB as a storage, RPC for node-to-node communication and UDP multicast for node discovery. The project is planned to go open source.

##### Data retrieval and manipulation framework
A framework that abstracts low-level network, file and database operations, and provides generic functionality to fetch, parse, normalize, validate data from a remote source, and then persist the data in a store, e.g. MongoDB.

Stored data is part of a collection. A collection is made up of one or many data objects (models). A user can manipulate data from a store by performing operations on an entire collection or on individual models.

The framework eliminates existing and potential code duplication by exposing a reusable, configurable API, significantly decreasing maintenance and development time.
